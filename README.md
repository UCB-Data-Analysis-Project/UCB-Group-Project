# UCB-Group-Project
Group project for UCB Data analytics course

## DataBase
For this project, our group will be using AWS as we'll be able to connect via the cloud. In doing so, I'll be setting up a Postgres database using AWS's relational database service (RDS) named "Heart_Atttacks". AWS S3 will be our main storage for our data files and images will store for our projects. Additional bucket will be created if need. An ERD model will also be created to connect our datasets to each other and eventually merge into different subset tables. In doing so, we'll be able to connect the main 14 components of heart attacks with other valuable data such as socio-economic status, diets, CDC guidelines, etc.

Main components of the DataBase will include:
  - ERD Model
  - Schema for tables we'll create 

Data Sets include but not limited to:
  - ADD FILES
  - ADD FILES
