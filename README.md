# UCB-Group-Project
Group project for UCB Data analytics course


## Project Summary
- The goal of the project is to create a dynamic model that will predict heart diease based on a varity of attributes. This model will be able to take in new information from users and generate predictions from that data.
- We will be using a variy of different data sets (links below). __Note to team Please add the links to any other data sets that you use to this list.__
    * https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease - Database of heart diease by biological factors
    * https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm - Database of heart diease by biological factors
    * https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data?select=heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv - Database of heart failure clinical records dataset.
- The team hopes to show what factors can come together to create a greater chance of heart diease. We would like to exspand out into enviormental factors later in the project.

## Machine Learning Summary
The project entails predicting heart diease from 14 biological attributes using Machine Learning algorithms. The plan is to process the data, use different models to train and predict. This Machine Learning algorithm will be implemented in Python to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This project identifies as a classification problem, and this will assist us in predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms we plan on using:

- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
- Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
- Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
- Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
- Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
