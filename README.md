# UCB-Group-Project
Group project for UCB Data analytics course

## DataBase
For this project, our group will be using AWS as we'll be able to connect via the cloud. In doing so, I'll be setting up a Postgres engine using AWS's relational database service (RDS) named "The_Heart_Files". AWS S3 will be our main storage for our files and images for our projects. Additional bucket will be created if need. An ERD model will also be created to connect our datasets to each other and eventually merge into different subset tables. In doing so, we'll be able to connect the 14 biological attributes of cardiovascular disease with other valuable data such as socio-economic status, diets, CDC guidelines, physical attivity, etc. The goal is to have this linked with our machine leraning model so we can create our interactive dashboard for users.

Main components of the DataBase will include:
  - ERD Model
    - Sample ERD Model [Heart_ERD_MODEL]( )
  - Schema for tables we'll create 
    - Sample Schema's [Heart_Schema's]( )

Data Sets include but not limited to:
  - ADD FILES
