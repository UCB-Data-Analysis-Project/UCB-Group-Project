# UCB-Group-Project
Group project for UCB Data analytics course

The project entails predicting heart diease from 14 biological attributes using Machine Learning algorithms. The plan is to process the data, use different models to train and predict. This Machine Learning algorithm will be implemented in Python to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This project identifies as a classification problem, and this will assist us in predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms we plan on using:

- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
- Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
- Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
- Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
- Artificial Neural Network with 1 Hidden layer (Keras)
